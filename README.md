# Human-Activity-Recognition
 
In this project I make use of the Human Activity Dataset to perform some predictive modelling.

Link to the dataset:

EDA 1.ipynb shows some of the exploratory data analysis. Below are some of the tasks done as a part of the predictive modelling:

1. Data Cleaning
2. Feature names preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. TSNE Implementation

ML Models.ipynb file shows the implementation of various machine learning models along with their comparison. I made use of some of the helper functions such as perform_model, print_grid_search_attributes and plot_confusion_matrix.

Below are the ML models that were implemented:
1. Logistic Regression with Grid Search
2. Linear SVC with GridSearch
3. Kernel SVM with GridSearch
4. Decision Trees with GridSearchCV
5. Random Forest Classifier with GridSearch
6. Gradient Boosted Decision Trees With GridSearch
